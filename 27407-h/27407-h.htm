5</span>THE RETURN OF THE DEAD</h2>
<p>Swayne Dyring o&rsquo;er to the island strayed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
He wedded there a lovely maid&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>Together they lived seven years and more;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
And seven fair babes to him she bore&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>Then death arrived in luckless hour;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
Then died the lovely lily flower&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>The Swayne he has crossed the salt sea way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
And he has wedded another may&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>And he that may to his home has brought;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
But peevish was she, and with malice fraught&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>And when she came to the castle gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
The seven children beside it wait&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>The children stood in sorrowful mood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
She spurned them away with her foot so rude&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>Nor bread nor meat will she bestow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
Said &ldquo;Hate ye shall have and the hunger
throe&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>She took away the bolsters blue;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
&ldquo;Bare straw will serve for the like of you&rdquo;&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>Away she&rsquo;s ta&rsquo;en the big wax light;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
Said she &ldquo;Ye shall lie in the murky night&rdquo;&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>The babies at night with hunger weep;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
The woman heard that in the grave so deep&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>To God&rsquo;s high throne such haste she made;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
&ldquo;O I must go to my babies&rsquo; aid&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>She begged so loud, and she begged so long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
That at length consent from her God she wrung&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>

&ldquo;No longer tarry must thou below&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>Then up she struck with her stark thigh bone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
And burst through wall and marble stone&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>And when to the dwelling she drew nigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
The hounds they yelled to the clouds so high&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>And when to the castle gate she won,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
Her eldest daughter stood there alone&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail daughter mine, what dost thou here?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
How fare thy brothers and sisters dear?&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>

9</span>&ldquo;O dame thou art no mother of mine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
For she was a lady fair and fine&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady fine with cheeks so red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
But thou art pale as the sheeted dead&rdquo;&mdash;<br />

Beneath the mould I&rsquo;ve long been dead&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>And when she entered the high, high hall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
Drowned with tears stood the babies all&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
The third she dandled, the fourth she hushed&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>The fifth upon her breast she plac&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
And allowed the babe of the breast to taste&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>To her eldest daughter she turned her eye;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
&ldquo;Go call Swayne Dyring instantly&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>And when Swayne Dyring before her stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
She spake to him thus in wrathful mood&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left behind both ale and bread;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
My children with hunger are nearly dead&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
Upon bare straw my babes I view&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left behind the big wax light;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
My children lie in the murk at night&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If again I&rsquo;m forced to seek thee here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
Befall thee shall a fate so drear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But hark! the ruddy cock has crow&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
The dead must return to their abode&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear, I hear the black cock crow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />

No longer here I dare to bide&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>Each time the dogs began to yell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
They gave the children bread and ale&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>As soon as they heard of the hounds the cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
They feared the ghost was drawing nigh&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>To honied words we list so fain</i>.</p>
<p>Whene&rsquo;er the dogs were heard to rave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And were I only young again</i>!<br />
They feared the woman had left her grave&mdash;<br />

13</span>THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL</h2>
<p>I take my axe upon my back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To fell the tree I mean;<br />
Then came the man the wood who owned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thrust his heft between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou hew down my father&rsquo;s grove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And me this damage do,<br />
If I but see thee fell the tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou dearly that shalt rue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O let me hew this single tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor to resist me seek;<br />
Unless I yonder bird obtain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With grief my heart will break.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;Now list thou fair and gallant swain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To me incline thine ear!<br />
Thou ne&rsquo;er wilt yonder bird obtain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless some bait thou bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From off my breast the bait I cut,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hung it on the bough:<br />
The breast it bled, the bait it reeked,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine is the birdie now.</p>
<p>Down flew the lovely little bird,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fluttering its wings o&rsquo;erjoyed;<br />
It seemed to smile as if the guile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It knew that I employed.</p>
<p>It clawed and picked so hastily,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So well did smack the bait;<br />
And still the more it seemed to please<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The more the birdie ate.</p>
<p>Down flew the lovely little bird,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alighting on the sand;<br />
The loveliest damsel she became,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave the youth her hand.</p>
<h2><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>THE FORCED CONSENT</h2>
<p>Within her own fair castelaye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There goes a damsel bright;<br />
A whole year&rsquo;s tide for her has sighed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A young and handsome knight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do thou hear, thou beauteous maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could I thy troth obtain,<br />
Then thou shouldst tread on silk outspread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ne&rsquo;er on the earth again.</p>
<p>And do thou hear, my lovely maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My wedded lady be,<br />
And the slightest care thou shalt not bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If I can save it thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve vowed an oath to Mary maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to keep it is my plan;<br />
Ne&rsquo;er live will I beneath the sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With any sinful man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here with my seven brothers bold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To-morrow I will come;<br />
Yourself array in costly way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For you must follow us home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the young and handsome knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He out of the doorway springs;<br />
And he in haste the Runes has traced,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And them on her lap she flings.</p>
<p>And so he cast the magic Rune<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The maiden&rsquo;s dress below;<br />
Then beat her heart, and blood did start<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From her finger nails I trow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou with thy seven brothers bold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To-morrow here wilt come,<br />
Myself I&rsquo;ll array in costly way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And follow ye to your home.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>The very next morn, the very next morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When rose the sun in gold,<br />
Full three times ten bold knightly men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were waiting on the wold.</p>
<p>Full three times ten bold knightly men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a bonny grey steed each one;<br />
With silk so white was the courser dight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which the maid should ride upon.</p>
<p>But what think ye that maiden did<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere mounting on her horse?<br />
A draught she drank of poison rank,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thought death her wisest course.</p>
<p>Through the shallow streams they dashed their steeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the deep their steeds they swam;<br />
And ever and anon the maid would groan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;How dreadfully ill I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when they came to the house of the knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the bridal kept should be;<br />
Spread out on the earth was silk of worth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gold so red of blee.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;Now thou may&rsquo;st see, my lady love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I my promise hold;<br />
Now thou dost tread on silk outspread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And not on the earth so cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s spread enough of the silken stuff,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And plenty of gold is strown;<br />
But better I ween in heaven sheen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With our Father God to wone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they led her to the high, high hall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in scarlet her array&rsquo;d;<br />
But their joy was brief, soon came their grief,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She died alack a maid!</p>
<p>Thanks be to him the youthful knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No truer e&rsquo;er was seen;<br />
He built her a grave in the church, and gave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The churchmen farms fifteen.</p>
<p>Then as he stood by the maiden&rsquo;s grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gallant young noble cried:<br />
&ldquo;O would to God beneath the sod<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I were lying by her side!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>INGEBORG&rsquo;S DISGUISE</h2>
<p>Such handsome court clothes the proud Ingeborg buys,<br />
Says she &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll myself as a courtier
disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proud Ingeborg hastens her steed to bestride,<br />
Says she &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll away with the King to
reside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou gallant young King to my speech lend an ear,<br />
Hast thou any need of my services here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, my sweet lad, of a horseboy I&rsquo;ve need,<br
/>
If there were but stable room here for his steed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But thy steed in the stall with my own can be tied,<br
/>
And thou &rsquo;neath the linen shalt sleep by my
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Three years in the palace good service she wrought,<br
/>
That she was a woman no one ever thought.</p>
<p>She filled for three years of a horse-boy the place,<br />
And the steeds of the monarch she drove out to graze.</p>
<p>She led for three years the King&rsquo;s steeds to the
brook,<br />
For else than a youth no one Ingeborg took.</p>
<p>Proud Ingeborg knows how to make the dames gay,<br />
She also can sing in such ravishing way.</p>
<p>The hair on her head is like yellow spun gold,<br />
To her beauty the heart of the prince was not cold.</p>
<p>But at length up and down in the palace she strayed,<br />
Her colour and hair began swiftly to fade.</p>
<p>What eye has seen ever so wondrous a case?<br />
The boy his own spurs to his heel cannot brace.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>The horse-boy is brought to so wondrous a plight,<br />
To draw his own weapon he has not the might.</p>
<p>The son of the King to five damsels now sends,<br />
And Ingeborg fair to their care he commends.</p>
<p>Proud Ingeborg took they and wrapped in their weed,<br />
And to the stone chamber with her they proceed.</p>
<p>Upon the blue cushions they Ingeborg laid,<br />
Where light of two beautiful sons she is made.</p>
<p>Then in came the prince, smiled the babies to view:<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not every horse-boy can bear such a
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He patted her soft on her cheek sleek and fair:<br />
&ldquo;Forget my heart&rsquo;s dearest all sorrow and
care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He placed the gold crown on her temples I ween:<br />
&ldquo;With me shalt thou live as my wife and my
Queen.&rdquo;</p>

22</span>SONG</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve pleasure not a little<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A dancing youth to see,<br />
Nor less&mdash;one single tittle&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An old man full of glee.</p>
<p>To dance I ever glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With those of youthful mien;<br />
It shows, although I&rsquo;m hoary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In hair, my mind is green.</p>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
